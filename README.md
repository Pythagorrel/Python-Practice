My main language is Julia (see my other repositories for Plant Design and Process Simulation work)

This repository so far is just a collection of introductory Python scripts and logic puzzles I do for fun/practice

Contents (so far)

    Triangle.py: Logic to determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

    Currency Exchange.py: Basic financial calculations and handling float precision.

    Leap Year.py: Logic for calculating leap years.

    Little Sister Vocab.py: String manipulation and prefix/suffix handling
